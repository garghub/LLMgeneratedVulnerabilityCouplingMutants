## About the Dataset

In our study, we utilized the [Vul4J dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9796326), and accordingly, the directory names adhere to the naming convention as provided in the [mapping](directory_mappings.txt) file.

The dataset includes the following components:

1. **Source Code**: The source code of all projects, including both [vulnerable](code) and [fixed](fixed_code) code, provided in zipped format. Please note that for larger projects, there may be multiple zip files, each with a maximum size of 100 MB.

2. **Patches**: Individual classes modified during the fix, available as [patches](patches) for both vulnerable and fixed versions.

3. **Mutated Classes**: Individual [fixed](fixes_for_mutation) classes that underwent mutation.

4. **Mutants**: All the [mutants](mutants_mbert) generated for each project using [ÂµBert](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icstw/2022/962800a160/1E2wucGg7Ac).

5. **Vulnerability-Fix Information**: Comprehensive information on vulnerabilities and their fixes, including sentence-level changes, commit dates, and more, located in the [patches](patches) directory.

6. **Scripts**: A collection of scripts combined into a single Python [script](all_scripts_combined_together.py).
